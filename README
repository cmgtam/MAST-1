This is the README file for MAST.
The MAST team still needs to put information into README.

Required environment variables:

MAST_SCRATCH:  Scratch directory for storing temporary files related to running MAST
MAST_INSTALL_PATH:  Top level MAST directory
MAST_RECIPE_PATH: Path for MAST recipes
VASP_PSP_DIRS:  Location of the VASP pseudopotential library (required for PyMatGen)

MAST version "canoe" (nominally 2014_01_13, but not yet finished).
* Reorganized phonons - multiple phonons for defects and nebs
* Each NEB may have a different number of images
* Improved MAST error handling (for mastmon detected errors) and directory locking
* Improved and split mast-level logging (MAST_CONTROL/mast.log) and recipe-level logging (recipe directory, mast_recipe.log)
* Ability to skip recipes (MAST_SKIP file in recipe directory) and ingredients within recipes 
      ("skip" status in status.txt file in recipe directory)
* Ability to set mast_frozen_seconds for each ingredient type
* Ability to specify auto-error-correction or the writing of MAST_ERROR with the ingredient-level error message
      encountered. MAST_ERROR will also cause the recipe to be skipped over by MAST.
      Use mast_auto_correct in input file as True or False.
* Generic ingredient (for genetic algorithm and other scripts)
