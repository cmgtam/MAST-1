* Each NEB may have a different number of images

* Improved and split mast-level logging (MAST_CONTROL/mast.log) and recipe-level logging (recipe directory, mast_recipe.log)

      ("skip" status in status.txt file in recipe directory)
* Ability to set mast_frozen_seconds for each ingredient type
* Ability to specify auto-error-correction or the writing of MAST_ERROR with the ingredient-level error message
