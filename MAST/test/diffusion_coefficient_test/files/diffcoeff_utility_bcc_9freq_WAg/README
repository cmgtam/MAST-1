For the reported values in the diffusivity Excel files:

1) E0 and v0 are taken from the host-host numbers
2) Only a short range between ~0.5*Tmelt and Tmelt is used for the D0 and Q fit
3) After D0 and Q fitting, the host lattice corrections are applied:
Q reported = Q calculated + host adjustment for Q
D0 reported = D0 calculated * host adjustment for D0

So for W-Ag,
E0 = 1.6945 eV
v0 = 3.7501 THz

1/T between approx 0.5*Tmelt and Tmelt  ln(D)
0.0003  -20.04542064
0.0004  -25.09196488
0.0005  -30.10393532
0.0006  -35.05855901

Q short range approx -50051 * 0.00008617 eV/K = 4.313 eV
D0 short range approx exp(-5.0518) = 0.006398 cm2/sec
Q short range + adjustment = 4.313 eV + 1.3 eV = 5.613 eV reported
D0 short range * adjustment = 0.006398 * 800 = 5.118 cm2/sec reported
