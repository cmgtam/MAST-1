Citing MAST
==================

To properly cite MAST and its dependencies, go to your completed recipe directory in ``$MAST_ARCHIVE`` and locate the following file ::

    CITATIONS.bib

For example::

    cat $MAST_ARCHIVE/Optimization_Al_20140101T120000/CITATIONS.bib

This Bibtex-formatted file may be used directly with LaTeX or imported into a reference manager such as EndNote or Mendeley.
