###################################
The Personal Recipe section
###################################

The ``$personal_recipe`` section of the input file is generated by MAST and appears in the recipe-local ``input.inp`` file in the recipe directory.

Here, any <S>, <N>, <B>, <E>, <B-E>, <Q>, and <P> tags are extracted from the input file and substituted into the recipe.

The personal recipe is a good way to check exactly which ingredients MAST is going to run.

If errors are spotted in this section once the recipe directory has been created, it is best to:

#.  Remove the entire new recipe directory from ``$MAST_SCRATCH``

#.  Examine the original input file's ``$recipe`` section for errors and edit and save it

#.  Re-run ``mast -i <inputfile>.inp`` to create a new recipe directory in ``$MAST_SCRATCH``
