From the 'platforms' folder, copy the file for your platform
into this folder, without the platform tag:

For example, if you use the PBS/Torque queueing system, then
copy these files:
$MAST_INSTALL/submit/platforms/script_commands_pbs.py
$MAST_INSTALL/submit/platforms/queue_commands_pbs.py
$MAST_INSTALL/submit/platforms/submit_pbs.sh

as these files:
$MAST_INSTALL/submit/script_commands.py
$MAST_INSTALL/submit/queue_commands.py
$MAST_INSTALL/submit/submit.sh

For example, commands might be:
cp platforms/scripts_commands_pbs.py ./script_commands.py
cp platforms/queue_commands_pbs.py ./queue_commands.py
cp platforms/submit_pbs.sh ./submit.sh

***Note that some modification of these files may still be necessary for your system.***

Usually, the "submit_mastmon.sh" script should be slightly 
different than the submit.sh script generated for the 
ingredients. "submit_mastmon.sh" should take advantage of any
short walltime, backfill, or serial queues available on your 
system.
